This involves a deep understanding of algorithm design, resource management (like time and memory), and choosing the right algorithms for different scenarios. A high-quality program is characterized by its reliability (correctness), robustness (handling errors), usability (ease of use), portability (compatibility across platforms), maintainability (ease of modification), and efficiency (resource consumption). Code readability is also paramount, as programmers spend more time reading and modifying code than writing it from scratch, so clear and well-structured code is essential. While low-level languages like assembly language still have niche uses, most modern programming utilizes higher-level languages for increased portability."
